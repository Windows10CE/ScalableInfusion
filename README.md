# ScalableInfusion

This mod changes infusion's vanilla cap of 100 gained HP to instead be a percent of your base HP, so it scales (default 20% per infusion).

By default there is no hard cap on how much HP you can gain, but this can be added in the configs.

It also allows you to change how much health is gained per infusion per kill. (by default its the vanilla 1 HP per infusion stack)
