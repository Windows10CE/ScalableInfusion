# ScalableInfusion

This mod changes infusion's vanilla cap of 100 gained HP to instead be a percent of your base HP, so it scales (default 10% per infusion).

By default it also caps the total HP you can gain to 70% of your base HP, this is configurable.

It also allows you to change how much health is gained per infusion per kill. (by default its the vanilla 1 HP per infusion stack)
